# Heap-Merging-Program
This program merges two heaps (containing pre-set integers). The main purpose of this program was to practice node creation, heap creation from arrays and heap-merging.

How to execute/run the heapMerge program

Files needed:
1. node.h
2. node.cpp
3. main.cpp
4. makefile

Execution:
1. All of the aforementioned files should be in the same folder
2. The folder where the files are should be your present working directory
3. On the Terminal, type and enter the command "make clean" to remove any executables from previous compilations
4. Enter the command "make run" in Terminal to compile and execute the program

Using the running program:
1. The program prints the first heap in level-order traversal (from root to leaves)
2. The program then prints the second heap in level-order traversal
3. The program then prints out the merged heap in level-order traversal
